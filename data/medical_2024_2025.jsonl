TTE models provide many advantages over classification using fixed time horizons, including naturally handling censored observations, but are challenging to train with limited labeled data.

Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts.

Current approaches lack the temporal context necessary to identify biomarkers correlated with disease progression, as they rely on supervision derived only from images and concurrent text descriptions. To address this, we introduce time-to-event pretraining, a pretraining framework for 3D medical imaging models that leverages large-scale temporal supervision from paired, longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Using a dataset of 18,945 CT scans (4.2 million 2D images) and time-to-event distributions across thousands of EHR-derived tasks, our method improves outcome prediction, achieving an average AUROC increase of 23.7% and a 29.4% gain in Harrell’s C-index across 8 benchmark tasks.

Despite the growing body of work aiming to minimise demographic bias in AI, this problem remains challenging. A key reason for this challenge is the fairness generalisation gap: High-capacity deep learning models can fit all training data nearly perfectly, and thus also exhibit perfect fairness during training. In this case, bias emerges only during testing when generalisation performance differs across sub-groups. This motivates us to take a bi-level optimisation perspective on fair learning: Optimising the learning strategy based on validation fairness. Specifically, we consider the highly effective workflow of adapting pre-trained models to downstream medical imaging tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. There is a trade-off between updating more parameters, enabling a better fit to the task of interest vs. fewer parameters, potentially reducing the generalisation gap. To manage this tradeoff, we propose FairTune, a framework to optimise the choice of PEFT parameters with respect to fairness. We demonstrate empirically that FairTune leads to improved fairness on a range of medical imaging datasets.

In this paper, we propose the first fairness dataset for medical segmentation named Harvard-FairSeg with 10,000 subject samples. In addition, we propose a fair error-bound scaling approach to reweight the loss function with the upper error-bound in each identity group, using the segment anything model (SAM). We anticipate that the segmentation performance equity can be improved by explicitly tackling the hard cases with high training errors in each identity group. To facilitate fair comparisons, we utilize a novel equity-scaled segmentation performance metric to compare segmentation metrics in the context of fairness, such as the equity-scaled Dice coefficient. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our fair error-bound scaling approach either has superior or comparable fairness performance to the state-of-the-art fairness learning models.

However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.

Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence.To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans.To achieve it, we first formulate \\textbf{Region-Centric tasks} and construct a \\textbf{large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct,} to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a \\textbf{Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA}, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. The codes and model will be made publicly available.", "summary_cn": "提出首个双语区域感知医学多模态大模型MedRegA，通过MedRegInstruct数据集增强区域理解，在多种医学视觉语言任务中表现优异，提升模型可解释性与交互性。", "keywords": ["医学多模态大模型", "区域感知", "双语处理", "可解释性", "MedRegInstruct数据集", "视觉语言任务"], "triple": {"method": "构建MedRegInstruct数据集并训练区域感知模型", "result": "在8种模态的视觉问答、报告生成和分类任务中取得最佳性能", "contribution": "提升医学MLLMs的区域理解能力与可解释性"}}

It then verifies these triplets against a grounded knowledge graph, filtering out errors and retaining only accurate, contextually relevant information for the final answer.

In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a \\textit{ Spread Out in the End } information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability.

Recent methods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows, self-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance discrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse distillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to derive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring out-of-normal distributions. Further, we design a scale adaptation mechanism to softly weight contrastive distillation losses at different scales to account for the scale variation issue.

In contrast, conformal prediction (region prediction) offers a principled alternative by generating prediction sets with finite-sample validity guarantees, ensuring that the ground truth is contained within the set at a specified confidence level.In this study, we explore the impact of pre-training approach, dataset scale and domain on both point and region-level uncertainty quantification, by studying domain-specific vision medical foundation models vs. general domain vision foundation models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across foundation models trained on retinal, histopathological, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, applying various calibration techniques.

Recent works have found that the generalization error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension ($d_{data}$) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to $d_{data}$, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic ``label sharpness'' ($K_\\mathcal{F}$) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated with the trained model's adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial attack. Finally, we extend our $d_{data}$ formalism to the related metric of learned representation intrinsic dimension ($d_{repr}$), derive a generalization scaling law with respect to $d_{repr}$, and show that $d_{data}$ serves as an upper bound for $d_{repr}$. Our theoretical results are supported by thorough experiments with six models and eleven natural and medical imaging datasets over a range of training set sizes. Our findings offer insights into the influence of intrinsic dataset properties on generalization, representation learning, and robustness in deep neural networks. *Code link: https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/intrinsic-properties*", "summary_cn": "研究神经网络在自然与医学图像学习中的差异，提出标签锐度解释泛化差距，并揭示医学图像对抗脆弱性更高。", "keywords": ["泛化误差", "内在维度", "标签锐度", "对抗鲁棒性", "医学图像", "神经网络"], "triple": {"method": "提出标签锐度度量与泛化缩放定律", "result": "医学图像标签锐度高导致泛化差距大且对抗脆弱性强", "contribution": "揭示数据集内在属性对泛化与鲁棒性的影响"}}

However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and comprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings. Recent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality supervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image interpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images with reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and report sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for anatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. Fine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges, mainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly diseased abnormalities, leading to ambiguous patient-level pairings. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false negatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive learning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT dataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease (including several most deadly cancers) diagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation.

To facilitate fair comparisons, we utilize a novel equity-scaled segmentation performance metric to compare segmentation metrics in the context of fairness, such as the equity-scaled Dice coefficient.

Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a \\textbf{Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA}, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility.

Recent studies leverage grounded vision-language models (GLIP) to achieve this by using detailed disease descriptions as prompts for the target disease name during the inference phase.  However, these methods typically treat prompts as equivalent context to the target name, making it difficult to assign specific disease knowledge based on visual information, leading to a coarse alignment between images and target descriptions. In this paper, we propose StructuralGLIP, which introduces an auxiliary branch to encode prompts into a latent knowledge bank layer-by-layer, enabling more context-aware and fine-grained alignment. Specifically, in each layer, we select highly similar features from both the image representation and the knowledge bank, forming structural representations that capture nuanced relationships between image patches and target descriptions. These features are then fused across modalities to further enhance detection performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate that StructuralGLIP achieves a +4.1\\% AP improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods across seven zero-shot medical detection benchmarks, and consistently improves fine-tuned models by +3.2\\% AP on endoscopy image datasets.", "summary_cn": "提出StructuralGLIP，通过分层编码提示构建知识库，实现图像与疾病描述的细粒度对齐，提升零样本医学检测性能。", "keywords": ["零样本医学检测", "视觉语言模型", "细粒度对齐", "知识库", "结构表示", "GLIP"], "triple": {"method": "分层编码提示构建知识库，选择高相似特征形成结构表示", "result": "在七个基准上AP提升4.1%，内窥镜数据集上微调模型AP提升3.2%", "contribution": "增强图像与疾病描述的细粒度对齐，提升零样本检测性能"}}

This direction of research is particularly relevant to medical imaging because accurate medical image analysis and generation consist of a combination of reasoning based on visual features and prior knowledge. Many recent works have focused on training adapter networks that serve as an information bridge between image processing (encoding or generating) networks and LLMs; but presumably, in order to achieve maximum reasoning potential of LLMs on visual information as well, visual and language features should be allowed to interact more freely. This is especially important in the medical domain because understanding and generating medical images such as chest X-rays (CXR) require not only accurate visual and language-based reasoning but also a more intimate mapping between the two modalities. Thus, taking inspiration from previous work on the transformer and VQ-GAN combination for bidirectional image and text generation, we build upon this approach and develop a method for instruction-tuning an LLM pre-trained only on text to gain vision-language capabilities for medical images. Specifically, we leverage a pretrained LLM’s existing question-answering and instruction-following abilities to teach it to understand visual inputs by instructing it to answer questions about image inputs and, symmetrically, output both text and image responses appropriate to a given query by tuning the LLM with diverse tasks that encompass image-based text-generation and text-based image-generation. We show that our LLM-CXR trained in this approach shows better image-text alignment in both CXR understanding and generation tasks while being smaller in size compared to previously developed models that perform a narrower range of tasks.", "summary_cn": "本研究开发了LLM-CXR模型，通过指令微调使文本预训练大语言模型具备医学影像理解与生成能力，在胸部X光任务中实现更好的图文对齐。", "keywords": ["大语言模型", "医学影像", "指令微调", "胸部X光", "多模态学习", "图像生成"], "triple": {"method": "指令微调预训练LLM", "result": "提升CXR图文对齐能力", "contribution": "开发轻量多功能医学多模态模型"}}

It fulfills the needs in real-world diagnosis protocol to leverage information from different data sources and simultaneously perform mutually informative tasks. However, medical imaging domains introduce two key challenges: dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence. The quality and amount of task-related information from different modalities could vary significantly across patient samples, due to biological and demographic factors. Traditional fusion methods apply fixed combination strategies that fail to capture this dynamic relationship, potentially underutilizing modalities that carry stronger diagnostic signals for specific patients. Additionally, different clinical tasks may require dynamic feature selection and combination from various modalities, a phenomenon we term “modality-task dependence.” To address these issues, we propose M4oE, a novel Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts framework for precise Medical diagnosis. M4oE comprises Modality-Specific (MSoE) modules and a Modality-shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module. With collaboration from both modules, our model dynamically decomposes and learns distinct and shared information from different modalities and achieves dynamic fusion. MToE provides a joint probability model of modalities and tasks by using experts as a link and encourages experts to learn modality-task dependence via conditional mutual information loss. By doing so, M4oE offers sample and population-level interpretability of modality contributions. We evaluate M4oE on four public multi-modal medical benchmark datasets for solving two important medical diagnostic problems including breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis.

This raises the question: Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data? To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective.Our results show that MedVLP models trained exclusively on synthetic data outperform those trained on real data by 3.8% in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification.

KARE constructs a comprehensive multi-source KG by integrating biomedical databases, clinical literature, and LLM-generated insights, and organizes it using hierarchical graph community detection and summarization for precise and contextually relevant information retrieval.

While deep learning has exhibited impressive capacities across various healthcare domains, its applicability in BCBM diseases is consistently hindered by the lack of an open, large-scale, deep learning-ready dataset. As such, we introduce the Bone Metastasis (BoneMet) dataset, the first large-scale, publicly available, high-resolution medical resource, which is derived from a well-accepted murine BCBM model. The unique advantage of BoneMet over existing human datasets is repeated sequential scans per subject over the entire disease development phases. The dataset consists of over 67 terabytes of multi-modal medical data, including 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and detailed biological data (e.g., medical records and bone quantitative analysis), collected from more than five hundreds mice spanning from 2019 to 2024. Our BoneMet dataset is well-organized into six components, i.e., RotationX-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec. We further show that BoneMet can be readily adopted to build versatile, large-scale AI models for managing BCBM diseases in terms of diagnosis using 2D or 3D images, prognosis of bone deterioration, and sparse-angle 3D reconstruction for safe long-term disease monitoring. Our preliminary results demonstrate that BoneMet has the potentials to jump-start the development and fine-tuning of AI-driven solutions prior to their applications to human patients. To facilitate its easy access and wide dissemination, we have created the BoneMet package, providing three APIs that enable researchers to (i) flexibly process and download the BoneMet data filtered by specific time frames; and (ii) develop and train large-scale AI models for precise BCBM diagnosis and prognosis.

These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions.

Today, wearable devices can conveniently record various biosignals, creating the opportunity to monitor health status without disruption to one's daily routine. Despite widespread use of wearable devices and existing digital biomarkers, the absence of curated data with annotated medical labels hinders the development of new biomarkers to measure common health conditions. In fact, medical datasets are usually small in comparison to other domains, which is an obstacle for developing neural network models for biosignals. To address this challenge, we have employed self-supervised learning using the unlabeled sensor data collected under informed consent from the large longitudinal Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) to train foundation models for two common biosignals: photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded on Apple Watch. We curated PPG and ECG datasets from AHMS that include data from ${\\sim} 141$K participants spanning ${\\sim} 3$ years. Our self-supervised learning framework includes participant level positive pair selection, stochastic augmentation module and a regularized contrastive loss optimized with momentum training, and generalizes well to both PPG and ECG modalities.

Although integrating these two families of approaches seems like a natural next step, in practice, creating such a design is challenging and has not been done. This is partly due to known EHR problems, such as high sparsity, making extracting meaningful temporal representations of medical visits challenging. In this study, we propose GT-BEHRT, a new approach that leverages temporal visit embeddings extracted from a graph transformer and uses a BERT-based model to obtain more robust patient representations, especially on longer EHR sequences.

It fulfills the needs in real-world diagnosis protocol to leverage information from different data sources and simultaneously perform mutually informative tasks. However, medical imaging domains introduce two key challenges: dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence. The quality and amount of task-related information from different modalities could vary significantly across patient samples, due to biological and demographic factors. Traditional fusion methods apply fixed combination strategies that fail to capture this dynamic relationship, potentially underutilizing modalities that carry stronger diagnostic signals for specific patients. Additionally, different clinical tasks may require dynamic feature selection and combination from various modalities, a phenomenon we term “modality-task dependence.” To address these issues, we propose M4oE, a novel Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts framework for precise Medical diagnosis. M4oE comprises Modality-Specific (MSoE) modules and a Modality-shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module. With collaboration from both modules, our model dynamically decomposes and learns distinct and shared information from different modalities and achieves dynamic fusion. MToE provides a joint probability model of modalities and tasks by using experts as a link and encourages experts to learn modality-task dependence via conditional mutual information loss. By doing so, M4oE offers sample and population-level interpretability of modality contributions. We evaluate M4oE on four public multi-modal medical benchmark datasets for solving two important medical diagnostic problems including breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis.

Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of moderate lengths and greater. To mitigate this, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model which operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly reduced computational costs, critical for addressing long-range dependencies common in medical contexts. In particular, we propose multi-view signature attention, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global dependencies in input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency.

In this paper, we propose a causality-based alignment framework towards aligning the model's decision process with that of experts. Specifically, we first employ counterfactual generation to identify the causal chain of model decisions. To align this causal chain with that of experts, we propose a causal alignment loss that enforces the model to focus on causal factors underlying each decision step in the whole causal chain. To optimize this loss that involves the counterfactual generator as an implicit function of the model's parameters, we employ the implicit function theorem equipped with the conjugate gradient method for efficient estimation.

Unfortunately, when rewards are only partially observed, the effectiveness of OPL degrades severely. Well-known examples of such partial rewards include explicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce platforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical problems. One possible solution to deal with such partial rewards is to use secondary rewards, such as dwelling time, clicks, and medical indicators, which are more densely observed. However, relying solely on such secondary rewards can also lead to poor policy learning since they may not align with the target reward. Thus, this work studies a new and general problem of OPL where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected target reward by leveraging densely observed secondary rewards as supplemental data. We then propose a new method called Hybrid Policy Optimization for Partially-Observed Reward (HyPeR), which effectively uses the secondary rewards in addition to the partially observed target reward to achieve effective OPL despite the challenging scenario. We also discuss a case where we aim to optimize not only the expected target reward but also the expected secondary rewards to some extent; counter-intuitively, we will show that leveraging the two objectives is in fact advantageous also for the optimization of only the target reward.

Our study also investigates the consensus among LLMs in evaluating LVMs using BSS, indicating that LLMs generally reach substantial consensus in rating LVMs, with some variation dependant on the cancer type.

In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains.

While deep learning has exhibited impressive capacities across various healthcare domains, its applicability in BCBM diseases is consistently hindered by the lack of an open, large-scale, deep learning-ready dataset. As such, we introduce the Bone Metastasis (BoneMet) dataset, the first large-scale, publicly available, high-resolution medical resource, which is derived from a well-accepted murine BCBM model. The unique advantage of BoneMet over existing human datasets is repeated sequential scans per subject over the entire disease development phases. The dataset consists of over 67 terabytes of multi-modal medical data, including 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and detailed biological data (e.g., medical records and bone quantitative analysis), collected from more than five hundreds mice spanning from 2019 to 2024. Our BoneMet dataset is well-organized into six components, i.e., RotationX-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec. We further show that BoneMet can be readily adopted to build versatile, large-scale AI models for managing BCBM diseases in terms of diagnosis using 2D or 3D images, prognosis of bone deterioration, and sparse-angle 3D reconstruction for safe long-term disease monitoring. Our preliminary results demonstrate that BoneMet has the potentials to jump-start the development and fine-tuning of AI-driven solutions prior to their applications to human patients. To facilitate its easy access and wide dissemination, we have created the BoneMet package, providing three APIs that enable researchers to (i) flexibly process and download the BoneMet data filtered by specific time frames; and (ii) develop and train large-scale AI models for precise BCBM diagnosis and prognosis.

This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs, but remains unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, especially when integrating three or more modalities.In this work, we propose a modality-agnostic framework that definitively closes the modality gap across multiple modalities, ensuring that semantically related representations are perfectly aligned, regardless of their source modality. Beyond theoretical improvements, we demonstrate that closing the modality gap has profound implications for real-world applications. In semantic communication, our approach enables the transmission of a single compact representation per semantic concept, drastically reducing bandwidth requirements while preserving multimodal reconstruction quality.

Unfortunately, when rewards are only partially observed, the effectiveness of OPL degrades severely. Well-known examples of such partial rewards include explicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce platforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical problems. One possible solution to deal with such partial rewards is to use secondary rewards, such as dwelling time, clicks, and medical indicators, which are more densely observed. However, relying solely on such secondary rewards can also lead to poor policy learning since they may not align with the target reward. Thus, this work studies a new and general problem of OPL where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected target reward by leveraging densely observed secondary rewards as supplemental data. We then propose a new method called Hybrid Policy Optimization for Partially-Observed Reward (HyPeR), which effectively uses the secondary rewards in addition to the partially observed target reward to achieve effective OPL despite the challenging scenario. We also discuss a case where we aim to optimize not only the expected target reward but also the expected secondary rewards to some extent; counter-intuitively, we will show that leveraging the two objectives is in fact advantageous also for the optimization of only the target reward.

However, manual annotation of such data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the target model and the judge model collaborate together. Here, a series of external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding the target model’s responses, mitigating biases in the rewarding process. In addition, a feedback mechanism is introduced to optimize prompts for both models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer significantly improves model alignment performance across four main applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55% in five natural language generation datasets, 3.66% in nine vision-language understanding datasets, 30.05% in three medical image analysis datasets, and 16.00% in four visuo-motor control tasks.", "summary_cn": "提出Anyprefer框架，通过双智能体协作与外部工具辅助，合成高质量偏好数据，提升基础模型对齐性能。", "keywords": ["偏好数据合成", "模型对齐", "双智能体协作", "外部工具", "反馈机制", "Anyprefer-V1数据集"], "triple": {"method": "双智能体协作与外部工具辅助", "result": "合成58K高质量偏好对，提升多领域模型性能", "contribution": "提出Anyprefer框架，缓解偏好数据合成偏差"}}

However, their security is threatened by backdoor attacks, which are achieved by adding artificial patterns to specific training data. Existing defense strategies primarily focus on using reverse engineering to reproduce the backdoor trigger generated by attackers and subsequently repair the DNN model by adding the trigger into inputs and fine-tuning the model with ground truth labels. However, once the trigger generated by the attackers is complex and invisible, the defender cannot reproduce the trigger successfully then the DNN model will not be repaired, as the trigger is not effectively removed. In this work, we propose Adversarial Feature Map Pruning for Backdoor (FMP) to mitigate backdoor from the DNN. Unlike existing defense strategies, which focus on reproducing backdoor triggers, FMP attempts to prune backdoor feature maps, which are trained to extract backdoor information from inputs. After pruning these backdoor feature maps, FMP will fine-tune the model with a secure subset of training data. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing defense strategies, FMP can effectively reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) even against the most complex and invisible attack triggers (e.g., FMP decreases the ASR to 2.86% in CIFAR10, which is 19.2% to 65.41% lower than baselines). Second, unlike conventional defense methods that tend to exhibit low robust accuracy (that is, the accuracy of the model on poisoned data), FMP achieves a higher RA, indicating its superiority in maintaining model performance while mitigating the effects of backdoor attacks (e.g., FMP obtains 87.40% RA in CIFAR10).

In fact, LoRA injects a new set of small trainable matrices to adapt an LLM to a new task, while keeping the latter frozen. At deployment, LoRA weights are subsequently merged with the LLM weights to speed up inference. In this work, we show how to exploit the unmerged LoRA’s embedding to boost the performance of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detectors, especially in the more challenging near-OOD scenarios. Accordingly, we demonstrate how improving OOD detection also helps in characterizing wrong predictions in downstream tasks, a fundamental aspect to improve the reliability of LLMs. Moreover, we will present a use-case in which the sensitivity of LoRA modules and OOD detection are em- ployed together to alert stakeholders about new model updates. This scenario is particularly important when LLMs are out-sourced. Indeed, test functions should be applied as soon as the model changes the version in order to adapt prompts in the downstream applications. In order to validate our method, we performed tests on Multiple Choice Question Answering datasets, by focusing on the medical domain as a fine-tuning task. Our results motivate the use of LoRA modules even after deployment, since they provide strong features for OOD detection for fine-tuning tasks and can be employed to improve the security of LLMs.", "summary_cn": "研究利用未合并的LoRA模块提升大语言模型的分布外检测性能，尤其在近分布外场景，增强模型可靠性和安全性。", "keywords": ["LoRA模块", "分布外检测", "大语言模型安全", "参数高效微调", "近分布外", "模型可靠性"], "triple": {"method": "利用未合并LoRA模块特征", "result": "提升近分布外检测性能，改善错误预测表征", "contribution": "增强LLM可靠性与安全更新"}}

Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning.  We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information.  We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.32% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving tokenization for medical foundation models.", "summary_cn": "MedTok多模态医学代码分词器结合文本描述与关系结构，提升电子健康记录模型性能，在临床任务中表现优异。", "keywords": ["多模态分词器", "医学代码", "电子健康记录", "图编码", "临床任务", "性能提升"], "triple": {"method": "结合文本与图编码量化", "result": "AUPRC提升4.10%-11.32%", "contribution": "统一医学代码分词器"}}

One key application of visual question answering in the context of the healthcare domain is automated medical report generation, where X-ray images and text-based symptom data for a patient might be provided as inputs, with the intention of generating a relevant medical report as an output. However, very few studies analyze the performance of these models alongside unimodal fine-tuned LLMs, and even fewer compare the performance of these multimodal models depending on whether they are provided symptom information as an input. In this paper, we compare the performance of a variety of approaches for generating medical reports on a dataset of Chest X-Ray medical reports, including a unimodal fine-tuned medical LLM, a multimodal model without symptom data, and a multimodal model with symptom data. Second, we introduce a new metric for evaluating the similarity between generated and reference medical reports, which we call \"sentence pairs\". Our results show that multimodal approaches to medical report generation far outperform unimodal approaches, and providing symptom data slightly improves accuracy for generated medical reports. We also find that our \"sentence pairs\" evaluation metric more closely measures similarity between generated and reference medical reports than standard techniques.", "summary_cn": "本研究比较了单模态与多模态方法在胸部X光报告生成中的表现，发现多模态方法显著更优，症状数据可轻微提升准确性，并提出了更优的评估指标“句子对”。", "keywords": ["医学报告生成", "多模态模型", "症状数据", "评估指标", "胸部X光", "视觉问答"], "triple": {"method": "比较单模态与多模态模型，引入新评估指标", "result": "多模态方法优于单模态，症状数据提升准确性，新指标更有效", "contribution": "验证多模态优势，提出改进评估方法"}}

Raptor leverages a frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes.

These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks—a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should—and indeed can—be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, “construct validity” refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying “construct”, that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.", "summary_cn": "本文主张医学大语言模型基准应优先考虑结构效度，通过心理学测试框架评估现有基准，发现其与现实临床任务存在显著差距，并展望构建有效基准的新评估生态。", "keywords": ["医学大语言模型", "基准评估", "结构效度", "临床数据", "心理学测试", "模型验证"], "triple": {"method": "类比心理学测试框架评估基准", "result": "发现现有基准与现实临床任务存在显著差距", "contribution": "提出以结构效度为中心的医学LLM评估新生态"}}

Traditional methods struggle to handle these inconsistencies, especially in complex medical scenarios where data types (like genes and pathology scans) are very different and their relevance can change. Key Insight: Not all data types (“modalities”) are equally useful for every patient or task. Some modalities might be highly informative for a specific case, while others are unreliable or irrelevant. Instead of treating all modalities the same, we need to dynamically weigh their importance and focus on the most trustworthy information. Our Solution: We propose a new approach called AMC to address these challenges. 1. Assess Modality Importance (“Top” Step): First, the model evaluates how useful each type of data (e.g., MRI scans vs. blood test results) is for the specific task, like cancer diagnosis. It does this by identifying which data types contain the clearest, most relevant information for the patient or condition at hand.2. Replace Unreliable Data with Useful Insights (“Down” Step): For each data type, the model then filters out uninformative or noisy parts and replaces them with insights from more reliable data types. For example, if a patient’s genetic data is of poor quality, the model might rely more on their imaging data instead. This “re-balancing” ensures the model focuses on the most trustworthy information from all available sources.3. Smart Fusion with a Customized Model: We design a flexible, efficient model (similar to those used in language apps like chatbots) to combine the re-balanced data. This model includes features to improve accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for medical use where trust and clarity are essential. Impact: Tests on real-world medical datasets showed that AMC performs better than traditional methods when data quality varies. Key benefits include: More Reliable Diagnoses and Predictions: By focusing on high-quality data, the model makes more accurate decisions, which is critical for treatments and personalized care. Flexibility Across Medical Fields: AMC works well for diverse tasks, from Alzheimer’s research to cancer subtype analysis, showing its broad utility in healthcare. Interpretability: The model’s ability to quantify which data types are most important helps doctors and researchers understand why it makes certain decisions, building trust in AI-driven medical tools.This approach could pave the way for more robust, adaptable AI in healthcare, improving how we use diverse data to better understand and treat diseases.", "summary_cn": "提出AMC方法，通过自适应模态令牌重平衡动态评估并融合多模态医疗数据，提升数据质量不均时的诊断准确性与可解释性。", "keywords": ["多模态学习", "自适应重平衡", "医疗AI", "数据质量不均", "模态重要性评估", "可解释性"], "triple": {"method": "自适应模态令牌重平衡（AMC）", "result": "在真实医疗数据上优于传统方法，提升诊断准确性", "contribution": "增强多模态医疗AI的鲁棒性与可解释性"}}

However, we argue that even when these methods produce literally accurate content drawn from source documents sans hallucinations, they can still be highly misleading. Patients may derive significantly different interpretations from AI-generated outputs than they would from reading the original source material, let alone consulting a knowledgeable clinician. Through a large-scale query analysis on topics including disputed diagnoses and procedure safety, we support our argument with quantitative and qualitative evidence of the suboptimal answers resulting from current systems. In particular, we highlight how these models tend to decontextualize facts, omit critical relevant sources, and reinforce patient misconceptions or biases.

In this paper, we introduce the Med-ST framework for fine-grained spatial and temporal modeling to exploit information from multiple spatial views of chest radiographs and temporal historical records. For spatial modeling, Med-ST employs the Mixture of View Expert (MoVE) architecture to integrate different visual features from both frontal and lateral views. To achieve a more comprehensive alignment, Med-ST not only establishes the global alignment between whole images and texts but also introduces modality-weighted local alignment between text tokens and spatial regions of images. For temporal modeling, we propose a novel cross-modal bidirectional cycle consistency objective by forward mapping classification (FMC) and reverse mapping regression (RMR). By perceiving temporal information from simple to complex, Med-ST can learn temporal semantics. Experimental results across four distinct tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-ST, especially in temporal classification tasks.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce the iDPA framework, which comprises two main components: 1) Instance-level Prompt Generation (IPG), which decouples fine-grained instance-level knowledge from images and generates prompts that focus on dense predictions, and 2) Decoupled Prompt Attention (DPA), which decouples the original prompt attention, enabling a more direct and efficient transfer of prompt information while reducing memory usage and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately addressed clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. In response, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by 14.2% and 51.7% on the Med-VQA and report generation tasks, respectively.

This method aims to safeguard the data against unauthorized training by inducing degradation in the generalization ability of the trained model.

To address this problem, we propose the Sparsity-Aware Local Masking (SALM) method, a novel approach that selectively perturbs significant pixel regions rather than the entire image as previously.

Specifically, for global feature distribution, we propose a Global Distribution Consistency Learning strategy that mimics the prior distributions of the foundation model layer by layer. For local fine-grained details, we further design a Localized Representation Alignment method, which promotes semantic alignment and generalization distillation between the specialized model and the foundation model. These mechanisms collectively enable the specialized model to achieve robust performance in diverse medical imaging scenarios.

We evaluated both models on public datasets for spleen and vertebrae segmentation, using a comprehensive suite of metrics covering both volumetric overlap (Dice, Jaccard) and boundary precision (Hausdorff Distance).

We present Score-Fusion, a novel volumetric translation model that effectively learns 3D representations by ensembling perpendicularly trained 2D diffusion models in score function space. By carefully initializing our model to start with an average of 2D models as in existing models, we reduce 3D training to a fine-tuning process, mitigating computational and data demands. Furthermore, we explicitly design the 3D model's hierarchical layers to learn ensembles of 2D features, further enhancing efficiency and performance. Moreover, Score-Fusion naturally extends to multi-modality settings by fusing diffusion models conditioned on different inputs for flexible, accurate integration.

This paper introduces Profile2Gen, a novel data-centric framework designed to guide the generation and refinement of synthetic data, focusing on addressing hard-to-learn samples in regression tasks. We conducted approximately 18,000 experiments to validate its effectiveness across six medical datasets, utilizing seven state-of-the-art generative models.

To address this issue, we introduce a novel concept called typicality, by exploring the locally defined dependency from a global perspective, to quantify how confident a point would be a mode. We devise an algorithm that effectively and efficiently identifies modes with the help of the global-view typicality. To implement and validate our idea, we design a clustering method called TANGO, which not only leverages typicality to detect modes, but also utilizes graph-cut with an improved path-based similarity to aggregate data into the final clusters.

Considering labeling large datasets is both time-consuming and expensive, active learning (AL) provides a promising solution to this challenge by iteratively selecting the most informative subsets of examples to train deep neural networks, thereby reducing the labeling cost. However, the effectiveness of different AL algorithms can vary significantly across data scenarios, and determining which AL algorithm best fits a given task remains a challenging problem. This work presents the first differentiable AL strategy search method, named AutoAL, which is designed on top of existing AL sampling strategies. AutoAL consists of two neural nets, named SearchNet and FitNet, which are optimized concurrently under a differentiable bi-level optimization framework. For any given task, SearchNet and FitNet are iteratively co-optimized using the labeled data, learning how well a set of candidate AL algorithms perform on that task. With the optimal AL strategies identified, SearchNet selects a small subset from the unlabeled pool for querying their annotations, enabling efficient training of the task model. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoAL consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to all candidate AL algorithms and other selective AL approaches, showcasing its potential for adapting and integrating multiple existing AL methods across diverse tasks and domains.", "summary_cn": "AutoAL提出首个可微分的主动学习策略搜索方法，通过SearchNet和FitNet协同优化，自动选择最优策略，在多种任务中实现更高准确率，降低标注成本。", "keywords": ["主动学习", "可微分搜索", "策略优化", "数据效率", "深度学习", "标注成本"], "triple": {"method": "可微分双层优化框架", "result": "优于所有候选AL算法", "contribution": "自适应集成多种AL方法"}}

In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG, focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225 different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal poisoning attacks in medical Q&A. In such attacks, adversaries generate poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we discovered that the deviation from the query’s embedding to that of the poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based defense to ensure the safe use of RAG.

Despite its strengths, SAM encounters two major challenges. Firstly, it struggles with segmenting specific objects autonomously, as it relies on users to manually input prompts like points or bounding boxes to identify targeted objects. Secondly, SAM faces challenges in excelling at specific downstream tasks, like medical imaging, due to a disparity between the distribution of its pretraining data, which predominantly consists of general-domain images, and the data used in downstream tasks. Current solutions to these problems, which involve finetuning SAM, often lead to overfitting, a notable issue in scenarios with very limited data, like in medical imaging. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLO-SAM, which finetunes SAM based on bi-level optimization (BLO). Our approach allows for automatic image segmentation without the need for manual prompts, by optimizing a learnable prompt embedding. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the risk of overfitting by training the model's weight parameters and the prompt embedding on two separate subsets of the training dataset, each at a different level of optimization. We apply BLO-SAM to diverse semantic segmentation tasks in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate BLO-SAM's superior performance over various state-of-the-art image semantic segmentation methods.

In this paper, we introduce the Med-ST framework for fine-grained spatial and temporal modeling to exploit information from multiple spatial views of chest radiographs and temporal historical records. For spatial modeling, Med-ST employs the Mixture of View Expert (MoVE) architecture to integrate different visual features from both frontal and lateral views. To achieve a more comprehensive alignment, Med-ST not only establishes the global alignment between whole images and texts but also introduces modality-weighted local alignment between text tokens and spatial regions of images. For temporal modeling, we propose a novel cross-modal bidirectional cycle consistency objective by forward mapping classification (FMC) and reverse mapping regression (RMR). By perceiving temporal information from simple to complex, Med-ST can learn temporal semantics.

However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately addressed clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. In response, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by 14.2% and 51.7% on the Med-VQA and report generation tasks, respectively.

We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes.

Specifically, Open-Det accelerates model training in both the bounding box and object name generation process by reconstructing the Object Detector and the Object Name Generator. To bridge the semantic gap between Vision and Language modalities, we propose a Vision-Language Aligner with V-to-L and L-to-V alignment mechanisms, incorporating with the Prompts Distiller to transfer knowledge from the VLM into VL-prompts, enabling accurate object name generation for the LLM. In addition, we design a Masked Alignment Loss to eliminate contradictory supervision and introduce a Joint Loss to enhance classification, resulting in more efficient training. Compared to GenerateU, Open-Det, using only 1.5% of the training data (0.077M vs. 5.077M), 20.8% of the training epochs (31 vs. 149), and fewer GPU resources (4 V100 vs. 16 A100), achieves even higher performance (+1.0% in APr).

For example, a model may identify objects based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than intrinsic features, resulting in degraded performance on data lacking these correlations. Existing mitigation approaches typically depend on external annotations of spurious correlations, which may be difficult to obtain and are not relevant to the spurious bias in a model. In this paper, we take a step towards self-guided mitigation of spurious bias by proposing NeuronTune, a post hoc method that directly intervenes in a model's internal decision process. Our method probes in a model's latent embedding space to identify and regulate neurons that lead to spurious prediction behaviors. We theoretically justify our approach and show that it brings the model closer to an unbiased one. Unlike previous methods, NeuronTune operates without requiring spurious correlation annotations, making it a practical and effective tool for improving model robustness. Experiments across different architectures and data modalities demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates spurious bias in a self-guided way.", "summary_cn": "NeuronTune提出一种自引导后处理方法，通过干预模型内部决策过程，无需外部标注即可显著减轻虚假偏差，提升模型鲁棒性。", "keywords": ["虚假偏差", "自引导缓解", "后处理方法", "神经元调控", "模型鲁棒性", "内部决策干预"], "triple": {"method": "在潜在嵌入空间识别并调控导致虚假预测的神经元", "result": "显著减轻虚假偏差，提升模型在不同架构和数据模态上的鲁棒性", "contribution": "提出无需外部标注的自引导后处理方法，直接干预模型内部决策过程"}}

CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies.

To bridge this gap, we propose to develop models that can justify the segmentation or detection using clinically relevant terms and point to visual evidence. We address two core challenges: First, we curate a rationale dataset to tackle the lack of paired images, annotations, and textual rationales for training. The dataset includes 180K image-mask-rationale triples with quality evaluated by expert radiologists. Second, we design rationale-informed optimization that disentangles and localizes fine-grained clinical concepts in a self-supervised manner without requiring pixel-level concept annotations.

When applied to solving inverse problems, the reverse sampling steps are modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (e.g., presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates our proposed step-wise and network-regularized backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions (implicitly or explicitly), our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our method as S tep-w i se T riple- Co nsistent Sa m pling ( SITCOM ).

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework termed Trusted Multi-view Classification Constrained with Expert Knowledge (TMCEK).

Despite its significance, the theoretical study of RR has received less attention, particularly in observational settings. This paper addresses this gap by tackling the estimation of RR in observational data. We propose several RR estimators and establish their theoretical properties, including asymptotic normality and confidence intervals. Through analyses on simulated and real-world datasets, we evaluate the performance of these estimators in terms of bias, efficiency, and robustness to generative data models. We also examine the coverage and length of the associated confidence intervals.

Geneticists use this data to build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models to optimize likelihood. Surprisingly, we find that larger models only improve performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small ones.

However, most current data pruning algorithms are limited in their ability to preserve accuracy compared to models trained on the full data, especially in high pruning regimes. In this paper we explore the application of data pruning while incorporating knowledge distillation (KD) when training on a pruned subset. That is, rather than relying solely on ground-truth labels, we also use the soft predictions from a teacher network pre-trained on the complete data. By integrating KD into training, we demonstrate significant improvement across datasets, pruning methods, and on all pruning fractions. We first establish a theoretical motivation for employing self-distillation to improve training on pruned data. Then, we empirically make a compelling and highly practical observation: using KD, simple random pruning is comparable or superior to sophisticated pruning methods across all pruning regimes. On ImageNet for example, we achieve superior accuracy despite training on a random subset of only 50% of the data. Additionally, we demonstrate a crucial connection between the pruning factor and the optimal knowledge distillation weight. This helps mitigate the impact of samples with noisy labels and low-quality images retained by typical pruning algorithms. Finally, we make an intriguing observation: when using lower pruning fractions, larger teachers lead to accuracy degradation, while surprisingly, employing teachers with a smaller capacity than the student's may improve results.

However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.", "summary_cn": "提出SoftShape模型，通过软形状稀疏化和学习模块，高效保留所有子序列信息并学习时序模式，提升时间序列分类性能与可解释性。", "keywords": ["时间序列分类", "形状稀疏化", "软表示", "模式学习", "可解释性", "高效分类"], "triple": {"method": "软形状稀疏化与学习模块", "result": "优于现有方法，生成可解释结果", "contribution": "提升分类效率与性能"}}

Despite their remarkable performance, LLMs exhibit a fundamental limitation: hallucination—the tendency to produce misleading outputs that appear plausible. This inherent unreliability poses significant risks, particularly in high-stakes domains where trustworthiness is essential.On the other hand, Formal Methods (FMs), which share foundations with symbolic AI, provide mathematically rigorous techniques for modeling, specifying, reasoning, and verifying the correctness of systems. These methods have been widely employed in mission-critical domains such as aerospace, defense, and cybersecurity. However, the broader adoption of FMs remains constrained by significant challenges, including steep learning curves, limited scalability, and difficulties in adapting to the dynamic requirements of daily applications.To build trustworthy AI agents, we argue that the integration of LLMs and FMs is necessary to overcome the limitations of both paradigms. LLMs offer adaptability and human-like reasoning but lack formal guarantees of correctness and reliability. FMs provide rigor but need enhanced accessibility and automation to support broader adoption from LLMs.", "summary_cn": "本文主张结合大语言模型与形式化方法，以构建可信AI代理。前者灵活但易产生幻觉，后者严谨但应用受限，整合可互补优势。", "keywords": ["大语言模型", "形式化方法", "可信AI", "幻觉", "系统验证", "AI集成"], "triple": {"method": "整合LLMs与FMs", "result": "互补灵活性与严谨性", "contribution": "提出可信AI代理构建路径"}}

These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks—a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should—and indeed can—be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, “construct validity” refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying “construct”, that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.", "summary_cn": "本文主张医学大语言模型基准应优先考虑结构效度，通过心理学测试框架实证评估，发现现有基准存在显著效度差距，并呼吁建立以有效基准为核心的新评估体系。", "keywords": ["医学大语言模型", "基准评估", "结构效度", "心理学测试", "临床数据", "实证验证"], "triple": {"method": "类比心理学测试框架，使用真实临床数据进行概念验证实验", "result": "发现流行医学LLM基准存在显著结构效度差距", "contribution": "提出以结构效度为核心的医学LLM基准评估新生态愿景"}}

Existing methods typically align vision encoders with LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but this often deteriorates their ability to handle multiple languages as training progresses. We empirically observe that imbalanced SFT datasets, largely English-centric, degrade performance on non-English languages due to the failure in multilingual token alignment. To address this, we propose Parrot, a novel approach that leverages textual guidance for visual token alignment at the language level. Parrot conditions visual tokens on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to align multilingual tokens. By computing cross-attention between initial visual features and textual embeddings, we select the most relevant experts, converting visual tokens into language-specific representations. Additionally, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark (MMMB), a new benchmark comprising 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, to assess multilingual capabilities.

In this paper, we propose a Test-Time Learning (TTL) paradigm for LLMs, namely TLM, which dynamically adapts LLMs to target domains using only unlabeled test data during testing. Specifically, we first provide empirical evidence and theoretical insights to reveal that more accurate predictions from LLMs can be achieved by minimizing the input perplexity of the unlabeled test data. Based on this insight, we formulate the Test-Time Learning process of LLMs as input perplexity minimization, enabling self-supervised enhancement of LLM performance. Furthermore, we observe that high-perplexity samples tend to be more informative for model optimization. Accordingly, we introduce a Sample Efficient Learning Strategy that actively selects and emphasizes these high-perplexity samples for test-time updates. Lastly, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and ensure adaptation stability, we adopt Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) instead of full-parameter optimization, which allows lightweight model updates while preserving more original knowledge from the model. We introduce the AdaptEval benchmark for TTL and demonstrate through experiments that TLM improves performance by at least 20% compared to original LLMs on domain knowledge adaptation.", "summary_cn": "提出TLM方法，通过测试时学习动态适应大语言模型，利用未标注测试数据最小化困惑度，提升领域适应性能至少20%。", "keywords": ["测试时学习", "大语言模型", "领域适应", "困惑度最小化", "低秩适应", "样本选择"], "triple": {"method": "测试时学习与低秩适应", "result": "性能提升至少20%", "contribution": "实现轻量级领域适应"}}

To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the twin at inference time.

However, their primary challenge lies in their design, which primarily accommodates 2D input, thus limiting their effectiveness for medical images, particularly radiological images like MRI and CT, which are typically 3D. To bridge the gap between state-of-the-art 2D VLMs and 3D medical image data, we developed an innovative, one-pass, unsupervised representative slice selection method called Vote-MI, which selects representative 2D slices from 3D medical imaging. To evaluate the effectiveness of vote-MI when implemented with VLMs, we introduce BrainMD, a robust, multimodal dataset comprising 2,453 annotated 3D MRI brain scans with corresponding textual radiology reports and electronic health records. Based on BrainMD, we further develop two benchmarks, BrainMD-select (including the most representative 2D slice of 3D image) and BrainBench (including various vision-language downstream tasks). Extensive experiments on the BrainMD dataset and its two corresponding benchmarks demonstrate that our representative selection method significantly improves performance in zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks. On average, Vote-MI achieves a 14.6\\% and 16.6\\% absolute gain for zero-shot and few-shot learning, respectively, compared to randomly selecting examples.

We propose Knowledge-Empowered Dynamic Graph Network (KEDGN), a graph neural network empowered by variables' textual medical knowledge, aiming to model variable-specific temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies in ISMTS. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained language model to extract semantic representations for each variable from their textual descriptions of medical properties, forming an overall semantic view among variables from a medical perspective. Based on this, we allocate variable-specific parameter spaces to capture variable-specific temporal patterns and generate a complete variable graph to measure medical correlations among variables. Additionally, we employ a density-aware mechanism to dynamically adjust the variable graph at different timestamps, adapting to the time-varying correlations among variables in ISMTS. The variable-specific parameter spaces and dynamic graphs are injected into the graph convolutional recurrent network to capture intra-variable and inter-variable dependencies in ISMTS together.

To address this gap, we first define the notion of medical safety in LLMs based on the Principles of Medical Ethics set forth by the American Medical Association. We then leverage this understanding to introduce MedSafetyBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to measure the medical safety of LLMs. We demonstrate the utility of MedSafetyBench by using it to evaluate and improve the medical safety of LLMs. Our results show that publicly-available medical LLMs do not meet standards of medical safety and that fine-tuning them using MedSafetyBench improves their medical safety while preserving their medical performance.

The model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce nuisance motion between visits.

We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness.

To remedy the underrepresentation of image sequences in existing medical visual grounding benchmarks, we propose MedSG-Bench, the first benchmark tailored for Medical Image Sequences Grounding. It comprises eight VQA-style tasks, formulated into two paradigms of the grounding tasks, including 1) Image Difference Grounding, which focuses on detecting change regions across images, and 2) Image Consistency Grounding, which emphasizes detection of consistent or shared semantics across sequential images. MedSG-Bench covers 76 public datasets, 10 medical imaging modalities, and a wide spectrum of anatomical structures and diseases, totaling 9,630 question–answer pairs. We benchmark both general-purpose MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) and medical-domain specialized MLLMs (e.g., HuatuoGPT-vision), observing that even the advanced models exhibit substantial limitations in medical sequential grounding tasks. To advance this field, we construct MedSG-188K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset tailored for sequential visual grounding, and further develop MedSeq-Grounder, an MLLM designed to facilitate future research on fine-grained understanding across medical sequential images.

To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization in MLLMs, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector in MLLMs. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics.

This eliminates the need for invasive procedures or uncertain treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose a method to identify digital twin model parameters using only noninvasive patient health data. We approach the digital twin modeling as a composite inverse problem, and observe that its structure resembles pretraining and finetuning in self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging this, we introduce a physics-informed SSL algorithm that initially pretrains a neural network on the pretext task of learning a differentiable simulator of a physiological process. Subsequently, the model is trained to reconstruct physiological measurements from noninvasive modalities while being constrained by the physical equations learned in pretraining.

Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only an 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, we observe that MLLMs are affected by a recency bias, where placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements of up to 71%.

Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date.

Noisy labels are a critical issue in medical datasets and can significantly degrade model performance.

In this paper, we propose CUFIT, a curriculum fine-tuning paradigm of VFMs for medical image classification under label noise. Our method is motivated by the fact that linear probing of VFMs is relatively unaffected by noisy samples, as it does not update the feature extractor of the VFM, thus robustly classifying the training samples. Subsequently, curriculum fine-tuning of two adapters is conducted, starting with clean sample selection from the linear probing phase. Our experimental results demonstrate that CUFIT outperforms previous methods across various medical image benchmarks. Specifically, our method surpasses previous baselines by 5.0\\%, 2.1\\%, 4.6\\%, and 5.8\\% at a 40\\% noise rate on the HAM10000, APTOS-2019, BloodMnist, and OrgancMnist datasets, respectively.

This paper examines the challenges LLMs face in processing medical codes due to the shortcomings of current tokenization methods. As a result, we introduce the UniStruct architecture to design a multimodal medical foundation model of unstructured text and structured data, which addresses these challenges by adapting subword tokenization techniques specifically for the structured medical codes. Our approach is validated through model pre-training on both an extensive internal medical database and a public repository of structured medical records. Trained on over 1 billion tokens on the internal medical database, the proposed model achieves up to a 23% improvement in evaluation metrics, with around 2% gain attributed to our proposed tokenization.

However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present \\textbf{m1}, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model’s medical reasoning capability at inference. Through extensive experiments on open-source LLMs (Qwen2.5, 7B and 32B), we demonstrate that increasing the ``thinking'' token budget consistently improves accuracy without additional model training. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling significantly enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models to achieve performance comparable to computationally intensive counterparts (e.g., our 32B model matches previous 70B-scale medical LLMs). We identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which controls test-time computation by extending reasoning through iterative prompts (e.g., appending \"Wait\"), helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, introduces errors into previously correct responses. Critically, our analysis highlights insufficient medical knowledge as a primary failure mode, a limitation unresolvable through increased reasoning alone, underscoring the necessity of incorporating medical knowledge. Furthermore, increasing data scale, enhancing data quality, or expanding model capacity consistently improves medical knowledge grounding and thus boosts performance, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach performance saturation.

While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies.

Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE, the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE) prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts, underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for more robust, equitable prognostic models.", "summary_cn": "本文提出FairTTE框架，首次从因果视角评估医学影像预后中的公平性，揭示普遍偏见并指出现有方法在分布偏移下效果有限。", "keywords": ["医学影像预后", "公平性评估", "因果分析", "时间到事件预测", "偏见来源", "分布偏移"], "triple": {"method": "开发FairTTE框架，整合TTE预测与公平算法", "result": "发现偏见普遍存在，现有方法缓解有限，分布偏移下公平性更难维持", "contribution": "首次系统评估医学影像预后公平性，强调需针对所有偏见来源的整体方法"}}

To address these challenges, we propose DAAC (Discrepancy-Aware Adaptive Contrastive learning), a learnable multi-view contrastive framework that integrates external normal samples and enhances feature learning through adaptive contrastive strategies. DAAC consists of two key modules: (1) a Discrepancy Estimator, built upon a GAN-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture, captures the distribution of normal data and computes reconstruction errors as indicators of abnormality. These discrepancy features augment the target dataset to mitigate overfitting. (2) an Adaptive Contrastive Learner uses multi-head attention to extract discriminative representations by contrasting embeddings across multiple views and data granularities (subject, trial, epoch, and temporal levels), eliminating the need for handcrafted positive-negative sample pairs.

A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings. Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept. We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets. In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average.

Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset consisting of 2,757 whole-body PET/CT volumes from independent patients and their corresponding full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. However, despite these advancements, the models still underperform on clinically critical criteria, particularly the diagnosis of lung cancer, indicating substantial room for future improvement.

However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications.

Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made significant advancements in natural image segmentation. Despite current studies indicating the potential of SAM to revolutionise medical image segmentation using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, it still faces three primary challenges. Firstly, these methods still rely on the large vision transformer of SAM, which is computationally expensive. Secondly, the point and box prompt modes of SAM demand manual annotations, which are time-consuming and expensive in medical scenarios and reduce their clinical applicability. Thirdly, SAM leverages large-size patches to predict masks, resulting in the loss of fine-grained details. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a fast-transferring architecture for adapting SAM to domain-generalised medical image segmentation, named Med-FastSAM. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight knowledge aggregation encoder that combines the distilled natural image knowledge with learned medical-specific information for producing feature representation. Moreover, we devise a coarse prompt module to automatically generate coarse masks for guiding segmentation decoding. Furthermore, we design a multi-scale feature decoder to produce precise segmentation masks. Eventually, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets have been conducted to evaluate the proposed model. The result demonstrates that Med-FastSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods without any manual prompts. Especially, our model shows excellent zero-shot domain generalisation performance by using only 15.45\\% parameters compared to the standard SAM.

Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering. Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect–direct axis that separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct). Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2\\% to as low as 13.5\\% for Claude Sonnet 4.

CARES includes over 18,000 prompts spanning eight medical safety principles, four harm levels, and four prompting styles—direct, indirect, obfuscated, and role-play—to simulate both malicious and benign use cases. We propose a three-way response evaluation protocol (Accept, Caution, Refuse) and a fine-grained Safety Score metric to assess model behavior. Our analysis reveals that many state-of-the-art LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreaks that subtly rephrase harmful prompts, while also over-refusing safe but atypically phrased queries.

We complement these quantitative probes with a small-scale human evaluation of model responses to patient-style medical queries to examine concordance between physician assessments of explanation faithfulness and layperson perceptions of trustworthiness. We find that CoT reasoning steps often do not causally drive predictions, and models readily incorporate external hints without acknowledgment.

Prior work shows that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve accuracy, raising the question of whether retrieval mitigates, exacerbates, or leaves bias unaffected, or if it introduces new forms of bias. To study this, we investigate patient-level bias through gender and ethnicity perturbations and physician-level bias through persona prompting, where models grade answers of a “female doctor” or “male doctor”. For the patient-level bias experiment, we compare a baseline LLM (GPT-4o Mini) to a MedRAG-enhanced version with two retrieval strategies(MedCPT and BM25) and two external corpora(Textbooks and Statpearls), while we extend evaluation to multiple models (GPT-4o Mini, Meta LLaMA 3.1 8B, Gemini, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) for the physician-level bias experiment, measuring endorsement and rejection accuracy to detect conservativeness or sycophancy.   We evaluate on the DiversityMedQA dataset, which perturbed MedQA questions along gender and ethnicity, totaling to 1,040 gender items and 1,068 ethnicity items where the clinically correct answer remains invariant under demographic edits. To reduce confounding, we modified only references to the primary patient, creating parallel male, female, and genderless versions, and used the released ethnicity subset as it was released by the dataset authors. We selected 300 gender pairs and 300 ethnicity pairs for analysis and utilized evaluation metrics including first-index accuracy, Majority@5, and total proportion, and applied two-proportion Z-tests to measure statistically significant disparities across demographic perturbations.  Altering the patient’s gender or ethnicity in the query had a negligible effect on base model performance: for both perturbations, first-answer accuracy, within the range of 69–71% for the original questions showed similar pattern for the perturbed pairs, and statistical tests confirmed no significant differences, indicating that diagnostic accuracy was not noticeably biased by patient demographic description. Retrieval augmentation (RAG) consistently boosted accuracy into the low-to-mid 70% range, improving performance without introducing new disparities. In the physician-persona experiments, all models showed a consistent conservative bias—more accurate at rejecting incorrect answers than endorsing correct ones—with highly significant gaps ranging from ~9 points (Claude) to over 40 points (GPT-4o Mini and LLaMA 3.1 8B).

We investigate this challenge and focus on model sensitivity to domain shifts, such as data sampled from different hospitals or data confounded by demographic variables such as sex, race, etc, in the context of chest X-rays and skin lesion images. A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings. Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept. We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets. In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average. Finally, evaluations reveal that PubMed is a promising resource for making medical models less sensitive to domain shift, outperforming other resources on both diversity of information and final prediction performance.", "summary_cn": "针对医学图像分析中的领域偏移问题，提出知识增强瓶颈模型，通过整合医学教科书和PubMed知识先验，提升模型在跨域数据上的泛化性能。", "keywords": ["领域偏移", "知识先验", "医学图像分析", "概念瓶颈模型", "PubMed", "泛化性能"], "triple": {"method": "知识增强瓶颈模型整合医学知识先验", "result": "在20个数据集上平均提升32.4%性能", "contribution": "降低模型对领域偏移的敏感性"}}

In this paper, we make an explicit correspondence between the mutual information of the distribution of per-pixel intensity and labels, and the performance of classical registration methods. This strong correlation hints to the fact that architectural designs in learning-based methods is unlikely to affect this correlation, and therefore, the performance of learning-based methods. This hypothesis is thoroughly validated with state-of-the-art classical and learning-based methods. However, learning-based methods with weak supervision can perform high-fidelity intensity and label registration, which is not possible with classical methods. Next, we show that this high-fidelity feature learning does not translate to invariance to domain shift, and learning-based methods are sensitive to such changes in the data distribution.

However, fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks remains challenging due to privacy concerns that limit centralized data collection from diverse sources. Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution by enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. Despite its advantages, FL must balance model performance with communication and computation costs. Existing approaches often use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to reduce communication overhead by transmitting fewer parameters. However, these methods require clients to host large foundation models, which is impractical for clients with limited memory. Meanwhile, conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fall short in FL due to misalignment between pre-trained foundation models and specific downstream tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose Federated Reprogramming Knowledge Distillation (FedRD), a method that uses lightweight student models in clients and a medical foundation model on the server. A reprogramming module aligns the foundation model's feature space with the downstream task, enabling student models to mimic this representation collaboratively. FedRD significantly reduces memory and computation requirements while maintaining high accuracy. Experiments on three medical imaging datasets under non-IID data distributions demonstrate that FedRD outperforms federated KD and PEFT methods, offering an effective trade-off between accuracy, communication, and computational efficiency.", "summary_cn": "提出FedRD方法，结合联邦学习与知识蒸馏，使用轻量学生模型和服务器基础模型，在保护隐私下降低内存与计算需求，提升医疗影像任务性能。", "keywords": ["联邦学习", "知识蒸馏", "医疗影像", "内存高效", "隐私保护", "非独立同分布数据"], "triple": {"method": "FedRD结合联邦学习与知识蒸馏", "result": "降低内存计算需求，保持高准确率", "contribution": "实现隐私、效率与性能的平衡"}}

Differentially Private Inference (DPI) offers formal guarantees against such leakage, but standard approaches severely degrade utility. Recent methods improve trade-offs by applying DP only to private tokens, yet this requires accurate tagging of private spans. In practice, privacy in medical text is highly context dependent and varies across organizations/jurisdictions, leading existing taggers to perform poorly. LLM-based taggers achieve higher accuracy but require costly fine-tuning and risk leaking private data through memorization.  We address this by introducing constitutional classifiers for private information tagging. Here, we learn a constitution i.e a set of natural language rules, directly from a small annotated subset, achieving stronger performance than existing taggers while requiring no fine-tuning. Importantly, the learned rules remain interpretable and auditable, allowing human experts to verify or edit them for compliance.

While optimization-based methods boast generalizability across modalities and robust performance, learning-based methods promise peak performance, incorporating weak supervision and amortized optimization. However, the exact conditions for either paradigm to perform well over the other are shrouded and not explicitly outlined in the existing literature. In this paper, we make an explicit correspondence between the mutual information of the distribution of per-pixel intensity and labels, and the performance of classical registration methods. This strong correlation hints to the fact that architectural designs in learning-based methods is unlikely to affect this correlation, and therefore, the performance of learning-based methods. This hypothesis is thoroughly validated with state-of-the-art classical and learning-based methods. However, learning-based methods with weak supervision can perform high-fidelity intensity and label registration, which is not possible with classical methods. Next, we show that this high-fidelity feature learning does not translate to invariance to domain shift, and learning-based methods are sensitive to such changes in the data distribution. We reassess and recalibrate performance expectations from classical and DLIR methods under access to label supervision, training time, and its generalization capabilities under minor domain shifts.", "summary_cn": "本文探讨深度学习在医学图像配准中的表现，发现其性能与像素强度-标签互信息相关，弱监督下可实现高保真配准，但对域偏移敏感。", "keywords": ["医学图像配准", "深度学习", "弱监督", "域偏移", "互信息", "性能评估"], "triple": {"method": "分析互信息与性能关联，验证经典与学习方法", "result": "学习方法弱监督下高保真配准，但对域偏移敏感", "contribution": "重新校准经典与深度学习方法在监督、训练和泛化方面的性能预期"}}

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1,  a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

In this work, we present AlphaMed, the first medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through reinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public multiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data. AlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks, outperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines.

(ii) How do dataset quantity and diversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the emergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset informativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist RL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning without CoT supervision.

RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley–Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training.

Recent literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically, through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical employs a shared matrix A for abstractive summarization, along with multiple isolated matrices B for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix A. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices B. Experimental results on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

To fill this gap, we propose BenchX, a unified benchmark framework that enables head-to-head comparison and systematical analysis between MedVLP methods using public chest X-ray datasets. Specifically, BenchX is composed of three components: 1) Comprehensive datasets covering nine datasets and four medical tasks; 2) Benchmark suites to standardize data preprocessing, train-test splits, and parameter selection; 3) Unified finetuning protocols that accommodate heterogeneous MedVLP methods for consistent task adaptation in classification, segmentation, and report generation, respectively.

Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence.

We propose to standardize OCT volumes to less anisotropic volumes by conditioning 3D diffusion models with en face scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) imaging data, a 2D modality already commonly available in clinical practice. We trained and evaluated on data from the multicenter and multimodal MACUSTAR study. While upsampling the number of slices by a factor of 8, our method outperforms tricubic interpolation and diffusion models without en face conditioning in terms of perceptual similarity metrics. Qualitative results demonstrate improved coherence and structural similarity. Our approach allows for better informed generative decisions, potentially reducing hallucinations.

Yet, the lack of annotated data and the impact of batch effects, e.g., systematic technical data differences across hospitals, hamper model robustness and generalization. Recent histopathological foundation models --- pretrained on millions to billions of images --- have been reported to improve generalization performances on various downstream tasks. However, it has not been systematically assessed whether they fully eliminate batch effects. In this study, we empirically show that the feature embeddings of the foundation models still contain distinct hospital signatures that can lead to biased predictions and misclassifications. We further find that the signatures are not removed by stain normalization methods, dominate distances in feature space, and are evident across various principal components. Our work provides a novel perspective on the evaluation of medical foundation models, paving the way for more robust pretraining strategies and downstream predictors.", "summary_cn": "研究发现，组织病理学基础模型虽提升下游任务性能，但未能完全消除医院间的批次效应，可能导致预测偏差。", "keywords": ["基础模型", "批次效应", "组织病理学", "特征嵌入", "泛化性能", "医院签名"], "triple": {"method": "实证分析特征嵌入", "result": "模型仍含医院签名，影响预测", "contribution": "为医学基础模型评估提供新视角"}}

Machine learning models can automate clinical consultations and auscultation, offering vital support in this area. However, the data involved, spanning demographics, medical history, symptoms, and respiratory audio, are heterogeneous and complex. Existing approaches are insufficient and lack generalizability, as they typically rely on limited training data, basic fusion techniques, and task-specific design. In this paper, we propose RespLLM, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that unifies text and audio representations for respiratory health prediction. RespLLM leverages the extensive prior knowledge of pretrained LLMs and enables effective audio-text fusion through cross-modal attentions. Instruction tuning is employed to integrate diverse data from multiple sources, ensuring generalizability and versatility of the model. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that RespLLM outperforms leading baselines by an average of 4.6% on trained tasks, 7.9% on unseen datasets, and facilitates zero-shot predictions for new tasks. Our work lays the foundation for multimodal models that can perceive, listen to, and understand heterogeneous data, paving the way for scalable respiratory health diagnosis.", "summary_cn": "提出RespLLM多模态大模型，统一文本与音频表征，通过跨模态注意力和指令调优提升呼吸健康预测的泛化能力，在多个数据集上表现优异。", "keywords": ["多模态大模型", "呼吸健康预测", "音频-文本融合", "跨模态注意力", "指令调优", "泛化能力"], "triple": {"method": "跨模态注意力与指令调优", "result": "在训练任务上平均提升4.6%，未见数据集上提升7.9%", "contribution": "提出统一多模态框架，增强泛化与零样本预测能力"}}

A ...", "is_main_conference": true, "abstract_source_venue": "NeurIPS", "abstract_source_url": "https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/133792", "full_title": "Cognitive Machine Learning for Reducing Survey Fatigue in Clinical Trials", "abstract": "Clinical trials are essential to advancing medical knowledge, but current data collection methods impose heavy cognitive demands on participants [1]. A major challenge is survey fatigue, particularly in electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs), where repeated questionnaires lead to habituation, superficial responses, and disengagement [2]. These effects undermine data reliability and erode trust in the trial process. We propose a cognitive machine learning framework that addresses this problem by embedding insights from cognitive science into ML-driven trial design [3].    We created a phased roadmap for combining cognitive science and ML in clinical research. Phase 1 introduces lightweight cognitive overlays into ePRO systems: adaptive phrasing, variable timing, and reinforcement learning-based adjustments designed to minimize cognitive load [1] while sustaining engagement through strategies analogous to cognitive behavioral techniques such as reframing and gradual exposure [4]. Phase 2 integrates a patient-first cognitive ML model trained with behavioral priors (e.g., Centaur-style models [5]) to sustain engagement and predict dropouts. This model delivers calibrated summaries and defers low-confidence cases to clinicians. Phase 3 reframes trials as cognitive ecosystems, where participant engagement metrics—such as attention, comprehension, and trust—become first-class endpoints alongside biomarkers.   We illustrate the feasibility of our approach through a survey fatigue case study. A conversational overlay adaptively rephrases questions, detects hesitation cues, and introduces cognitive scaffolding to sustain attention. Outputs are mapped back into standard ePRO formats with auditable traces. Early results suggest this approach can reduce missingness, improve response quality, and lower dropout risks while preserving regulatory compliance and clinician oversight [6].   Our work represents both an epistemic and ethical shift. It reframes survey responses not as noisy compliance data but as cognitively mediated signals. And by modeling participant comprehension, attention, and engagement, cognitive ML provides pathways to reduce attrition, improve inclusivity, and strengthen patient trust. This case study demonstrates how cognitively aware trials can enhance reliability, equity, and participant-centeredness.  References  [1] J. Sweller.

SAIC operates in two stages: (i) unsupervised subclass identification using a repulsive point process (k-DPP [2]) to uncover diverse and representative latent subclasses without prior assumptions, and (ii) subclass-aware classification with Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), which emphasizes minimizing worst-case subclass loss. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and CelebA) show that SAIC consistently improves robustness without compromising overall accuracy. Specifically, we compare against K-means- and GMM-generated subclasses [3, 1] and also give the accuracy obtained using true subclass labels, as given in Table 1. Beyond overall accuracy, SAIC’s clustering module demonstrates superior subclass identification, closely matching true subclass counts, preserving rare subclass purity, and maintaining moderate runtime efficiency. SAIC provides a scalable solution to hidden stratification by combining diversity-aware subclass discovery with robust optimization, thereby enhancing fairness and reliability in high-stakes classification tasks.", "summary_cn": "提出SAIC框架解决隐藏分层问题，通过无监督子类识别与分布鲁棒优化，提升模型在罕见子类上的性能，增强公平性与鲁棒性。", "keywords": ["隐藏分层", "子类识别", "分布鲁棒优化", "公平性", "无监督学习", "分类模型"], "triple": {"method": "k-DPP子类识别与GDRO优化", "result": "提升罕见子类性能，保持整体精度", "contribution": "增强分类公平性与鲁棒性"}}

Current reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have only been applied to time-to-event data, with the objective of maximizing expected survival time. However, alternating recurrent event data has a different structure, which motivates us to model the probability and frequency of event occurrences rather than a single terminal outcome.  In this paper, we introduce an RL framework specifically designed for alternating recurrent event data. Our goal is to maximize the probability that the duration between consecutive events exceeds a clinically meaningful threshold. To achieve this, we identify a lower bound of this probability, which transforms the problem into maximizing a cumulative sum of log probabilities, thus enabling direct application of standard RL algorithms. We establish the theoretical properties of the resulting optimal policy and demonstrate through numerical experiments that our proposed algorithm yields a larger probability of that the time between events exceeds a critical threshold compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms.", "summary_cn": "本文提出一种强化学习框架，针对交替复发事件数据，旨在最大化事件间隔超过临床阈值的概率，而非传统生存时间。", "keywords": ["强化学习", "生存分析", "交替复发事件", "概率最大化", "精准医疗", "最优策略"], "triple": {"method": "提出最大化事件间隔概率的强化学习框架", "result": "算法在数值实验中优于现有方法，提高事件间隔超过阈值的概率", "contribution": "为交替复发事件数据提供新强化学习目标，扩展精准医疗应用"}}

Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting approximately 10% of women, with adolescents often experiencing diagnostic delays up to three times longer than adults.1 Contributing factors include a lack of non-invasive diagnostic methods and symptom overlap with other conditions. Genetic variants may influence the risk of developing endometriosis2-4, but integrating genomic data into clinical decision-making remains underexplored. This project aims to combine large language models (LLMs) with genetic biomarkers to develop multi-modal, fine-tuned models for early and accurate detection of endometriosis in adolescents.  Methods. We collected 7,221 clinical notes from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse (MSDW) for 125 patients (ages 13–19) diagnosed with endometriosis. A subset of 700 notes from 26 patients was annotated by medical experts using standardized keyword-based criteria. These notes were segmented, tokenized, and encoded. The LLMs LLaMA, Gemma, GatorTron, and GPT-4o were fine-tuned for clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 metrics. In addition to the clinical notes, we obtained access to the Mount Sinai Million Health Discoveries Program for genetic data and are in the process of conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify endometriosis-associated markers. These genomic features, including SNPs and polygenic risk scores (PRS), will be integrated as structured inputs alongside unstructured clinical text to improve predictive accuracy and support personalized diagnosis.  Results. Across nine clinical symptom categories, GPT-4o-chat achieved the strongest overall performance, with an average F1 of 0.486 and accuracy of 0.871. Gemma performed moderately (F1: 0.261, Acc: 0.869), while LLaMA showed comparable accuracy (0.905) but a lower F1 (0.258). GatorTron obtained the lowest F1 (0.189) despite competitive accuracy (0.887). For endometriosis classification specifically, all models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.62), though GPT-4o-chat led with the highest F1 (0.771). These results indicate that GPT-4o-chat provided the best balance between precision and recall. However, performance varied widely by symptom, with models excelling in structured signals like pelvic tenderness but struggling on more non-specific categories such as GI symptoms. LLaMa exhibited the longest training and evaluation times.   Discussion. This study is one of the first systematic evaluations of open-source, trainable LLMs for NLP-based detection of adolescent endometriosis from unstructured EHR data. GPT-4o-chat demonstrated the strongest performance while maintaining computational efficiency, underscoring its potential scalability in resource-constrained clinical settings. By fine-tuning LLMs using EHR notes, these models can uncover subtle diagnostic patterns that are often missed in conventional workflows. Incorporating genetic information following GWAS will further enhance predictive power by enabling the models to capture both symptomatic presentation and underlying biological risk. Together, these findings highlight the promise of multi-modal frameworks to support earlier, more accurate diagnoses, guide personalized treatment strategies, and advance equitable care.

While advances in foundation models (FMs), offer promising avenues for enhancing SB care through intelligent, context-aware support, existing models struggle to accurately identify and reason about SB's diverse symptoms. This study benchmarks eight widely used large language models (LLMs) through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, focusing on their ability to address the unique medical challenges of SB. We introduce an \\textit{inverse prompting} technique designed to guide LLMs through a step-wise diagnostic process by incorporating a predefined symptom set relevant to SB, thereby preventing premature conclusions and improving diagnostic reasoning. Our evaluations reveal significant limitations in the LLMs' abilities to accurately diagnose SB-related conditions, underscoring the need for specialized approaches. Building on these findings, we propose a novel framework that integrates a structured, symptom-based knowledge base specific to SB, enhancing the models' contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities. This work highlights the potential of tailored AI solutions in improving access to care for individuals with SB, particularly in populations where gaps in knowledgeable providers persist.

In this paper, we exclude the boundary candidates that could be compromised by noise perturbation and aim to find the interior optimum of the black-box-constrained objective. We rely on the insight that optimizing the objective and learning the constraints can both help identify the high-confidence regions of interest (ROI) that potentially contain the interior optimum. We propose an efficient CBO framework that intersects the ROIs identified from each aspect on a discretized search space to determine the general ROI. Then, on the ROI, we optimize the acquisition functions, balancing the learning of the constraints and the optimization of the objective.

However, manual annotation of such data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods adopt a self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies due to the reward model sharing weights with the target model, amplifying inherent biases. To address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize high-quality preference data for the target model. Anyprefer frames the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the target model and a judge model collaborate. Here, a series of external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding the target model’s responses, mitigating biases in the process. We also introduce a feedback mechanism to optimize prompts for both models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer significantly improves model alignment across four applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55 in five natural language generation datasets, 3.66 in nine vision-language understanding datasets, 30.05 in three medical image analysis datasets, and 14.50 in four visuo-motor control tasks.", "summary_cn": "Anyprefer框架通过双智能体协作与外部工具辅助，自动合成高质量偏好数据，提升基础模型对齐效果。", "keywords": ["偏好数据合成", "模型对齐", "双智能体协作", "外部工具辅助", "反馈机制", "Anyprefer-V1"], "triple": {"method": "双智能体协作与外部工具辅助", "result": "合成58K高质量偏好对，模型对齐性能显著提升", "contribution": "提出自动偏好数据合成框架，减少人工标注依赖"}}
